## Description

![Kube-Combo](/docs/images/kubecombo.png)

Kube-Combo is a Pod-based orchestration system that provides a wide variety of network element capabilities, providing rich functionality and good operability.

**Rich features**
If you find that some advanced network features such as IPsec vpn GW, SSL vpn GW, Haproxy, Nginx etc. cannot be used directly in the K8S cluster, then Kube-Combo will be your best choice.
With the underlying capabilities provided by the K8S CNI, multiple POD payloads can be combined with a wide variety of mature applications to provide highly available and rich network element capabilities.

**Good operation and maintenance**
Kube-Combo supports one-click installation, helping users quickly build production-ready network applications.
At the same time, the built-in rich monitoring indicators and Grafana panel can help users establish a sound monitoring system.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kube-combo:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kube-combo:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
