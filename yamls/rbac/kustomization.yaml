  # All RBAC will be applied under this service account in
  # the deployment namespace. You may comment out this resource
  # if your manager will use a service account that exists at
  # runtime. Be sure to update RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding
  # subjects if changing service account names.
  # Comment the following 4 lines if you want to disable
  # the auth proxy (https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy)
  # which protects your /metrics endpoint.
  # For each CRD, "Editor" and "Viewer" roles are scaffolded by
  # default, aiding admins in cluster management. Those roles are
  # not used by the Project itself. You can comment the following lines
  # if you do not want those helpers be installed with your Project.
